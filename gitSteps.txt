🧩 Step 1: Create a GitHub repository

Go to https://github.com/new

Give it a name — e.g. cookie-bookie

Don’t check “Add README”, “Add .gitignore”, or “Add license” (you’ll do that locally)

Click Create repository

You’ll now see a page with a few command-line instructions — we’ll go through those below 👇

🧠 Step 2: Initialize Git in your local folder

Open your terminal inside your project folder (where your code will be):

cd path/to/your/cookie-bookie


Then run:

git init


✅ This creates a hidden .git folder and starts tracking your project.

🧾 Step 3: Add your files and make your first commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: setup Cookie-Bookie project"

🌐 Step 4: Connect your local folder to the GitHub repo

You’ll find your GitHub repo URL — it will look like:

👉 For HTTPS:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/cookie-bookie.git


👉 Or for SSH (if you’ve set up SSH keys):

git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/cookie-bookie.git

🚀 Step 5: Push your local code to GitHub
git branch -M main      # Rename master to main (GitHub uses main by default)
git push -u origin main


✅ Your code is now live on GitHub!

💡 (Optional) Step 6: Verify Connection

To confirm your repo is linked properly:

git remote -v


You should see:

origin  https://github.com/<your-username>/cookie-bookie.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-username>/cookie-bookie.git (push)

🎉 Done!

Now whenever you make changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
git push
